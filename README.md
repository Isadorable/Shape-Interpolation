# Shape-Interpolation

Shape interpolation studies how to generate intermediate shapes that smoothly interpolate the source shape and the target shape.
Given N keyframes/poses I am going to interpolate intermediate meshes in-between by linear interpolation and transformation-based
interpolation of mesh vertices
